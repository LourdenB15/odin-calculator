reset my code to work calculator, I was lost again.

work calculator commit issues:

    -3-, when clicked minus again results to "NaN-"
         it should return nothing 
           "-3x" works on times
           "-3+" works on plus
           "-3÷" works on times

    3-6 = -3
    -3   when input.textContent is just the answer like "-3"   
                    when clicked equal again, results to "NaN"
                    when clicked plus, results to "NaN+"
                    when clicked minus, results to "NaN-"
                    when clicked times, results to "NaNx"
                    when clicked divide, results to "NaN÷"

    -3x3 =, equal doesn't work on negative values
            it results to "NaN"
